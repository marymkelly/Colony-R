                Since the great success of humanity colonizing mars back in the year of 2050 it was not until the year
                of 2057 the general public were able to by real-estate on the planet mars. Colony-R was the first cosmic
                home builder company to sell houses to general public that year allowing anyone the opportunity to move
                off of earth to mars. Colony-R is well know for making cosmic real-estate much more affordable for the
                average person seeking to buy real-estate on the planet mars, with a fine tune for more luxurious homes
                for anyone who could afford it.
